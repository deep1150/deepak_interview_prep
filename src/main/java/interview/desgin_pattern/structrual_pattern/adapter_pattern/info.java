/**
 *
  Adapter Design Pattern
 Purpose: The Adapter pattern allows an object to interact with an interface
 that it would not normally be compatible with by
 converting the interface of a class into another interface expected by the client.
 It enables the integration of classes that otherwise couldnâ€™t work together.

 Key Components:
 Target: The interface that the client expects to work with.

 Adapter: Converts the interface of the adaptee into the target interface.
 It implements the target interface and uses an instance of the adaptee to perform the actual work.

 Adaptee: The existing class that needs to be adapted.
 It has an interface that is incompatible with the target interface.

 Client: The code that uses the target interface to interact with the adapter and, indirectly, the adaptee.


 When to Use the Adapter Pattern:
 When you need to integrate new functionality with existing code without modifying the existing code.
 When you want to reuse existing classes that have incompatible interfaces.
 When you need to provide a unified interface for different types of functionality.
