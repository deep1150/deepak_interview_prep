/**
 *
 * Definition:
 * The Flyweight Pattern is used to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.
 * It is useful when an application needs to create a large number of objects that have many shared or
 * invariant data across instances. Flyweight allows for the reduction of object overhead by sharing
 * common parts of the object between many instances.
 *
 *
 * Real-Life Example: Text Rendering
 * Imagine a text editor where you have to display large amounts of text.
 * Each character on the screen could be represented as an object, but this would be highly inefficient
 * since many characters will share the same formatting (font, size, etc.). Using the Flyweight pattern,
 * you can share character objects that have the same formatting.
