/**
 * Key Components:
 * Prototype: An interface or abstract class that declares a method for cloning itself.
 * ConcretePrototype: Implements the prototype interface and provides the actual implementation for cloning.
 * Client: Uses the prototype instance to create new objects through cloning.
 * When to Use the Prototype Pattern:
 * When the cost of creating a new instance of an object is more expensive than copying an existing one.
 * When you need to create a set of similar objects,
 * where each object is a modified version of a prototype.
 * When you want to avoid the overhead of initializing objects from scratch.
