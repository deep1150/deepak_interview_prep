/**
 *
 The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms,
 encapsulate each one as a strategy, and make them interchangeable.
 The key idea is to separate the selection of the algorithm from the implementation, promoting flexibility
 and reusability in the design.

 Key Concepts of Strategy Pattern
 Strategy: An interface that defines a set of actions or methods (the algorithm).
 Concrete Strategy: Classes that implement the Strategy interface, providing different implementations for the algorithm.
 Context: A class that uses a Strategy object and allows clients to change the algorithm dynamically at runtime.
 When to Use Strategy Pattern
 When you have multiple ways of performing an operation and you want to choose which one to use at runtime.
 When you want to avoid using conditionals to select the appropriate algorithm in your classes.
 When you want to follow the Open/Closed Principle by allowing the system to add new
 strategies without changing the existing code.
